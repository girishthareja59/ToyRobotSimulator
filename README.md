Toy Robot Simulator

Entry Point: Program.cs

Instructions:
1. Open the solution in your preferred C# IDE (such as Visual Studio).
2. The entry point for the code is Program.cs.
3. In the Main method of Program.cs, there is an array named "commands" containing test commands.
4. Modify the "commands" array to provide your own set of commands for testing the toy robot simulator.
5. Run the Program.cs file to execute the toy robot simulation.

Note:
- The toy robot simulation assumes a table grid of size 5x5.
- Invalid commands or placements that would cause the robot to fall off the table will be ignored.
- The robot's initial position is (-1,-1) until it is placed on the table using the "PLACE" command.
